# Flask Iris ML Model

## Overview
This project is a Flask web application that serves a machine learning model trained on the Iris dataset. 
The model predicts the species of the Iris flower based on input features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


## Features
- User-friendly web interface for predictions.
- Predicts Iris species based on feature inputs.
- Returns prediction results along with the photo of the predicted flower

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn (for modeling)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- HTML/CSS (for the front-end)
- numpy (for array creation)
